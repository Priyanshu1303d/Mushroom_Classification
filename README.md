# Mushroom Classification Project üçÑ

This project is a machine learning solution for classifying mushrooms as either edible or poisonous based on several distinguishing features. The dataset used is from Kaggle‚Äôs mushroom classification dataset, which contains categorical data about mushrooms, such as cap shape, color, and odor. The goal is to use machine learning models to accurately predict mushroom edibility, ensuring consumer safety and aiding mycologists in species identification.

### Project Overview

This project explores the use of various machine learning algorithms, including:
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Decision Trees**
- **Random Forest**
- **Neural Networks**
- **Naive Bayes**

The models were tuned with hyperparameter optimization and evaluated using key metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
